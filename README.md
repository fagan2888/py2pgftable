Py2PGFPlotsTable
================

TeX/LaTeX (see http://www.latex-project.org/) has been used as a configurable, clean, robust and free typesetting system for many decades now. Via many contributions from its community it has seen many extensions and enhancements via packages that can easily used (see http://www.ctan.org). Despite many packages for generating tables in LaTeX, it still remains cumbersome task to do.

This project aims to ease and automate the process, thus to fill the gap between generating data and writing the corresponding LaTeX commands to create a table.

As the comprehensive package pgfplotstable (see http://pgfplots.sourceforge.net/) provides many useful features to create tables in LaTeX, this code writes a LaTeX file to disk which uses pgfplotstable. The file can then be included in your LaTeX document with the \input{filename} command.

Requirements
================
 * Python (>= v. 2.7)
 * PGFPlotsTable (to be on the safe side, >= v. 1.9)
